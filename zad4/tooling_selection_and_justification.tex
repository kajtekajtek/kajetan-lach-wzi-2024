\subsubsection{Purpose}
\textbf{Core implementation} of the emulator. It will be used to implement the CPU, PPU, APU and other parts of the NES system.

\subsubsection{Justification}
C++ provides \textbf{high performance} and \textbf{low-level memory control}, which are critical for emulating hardware accurately. Its \textbf{rich ecosystem of libraries} supports tasks like file handling, input processing and graphics rendering.

\subsubsection{Integration}
C++ works seamlessly with graphics libraries like \textbf{SDL2} and \textbf{debugging tools}, providing a robust foundation for emulator development.

\subsection{Python}
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, and automation. Dynamically typed, garbage-collected, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

\subsection{ImGui}
ImGui is a C++ library for immediate mode graphical user interfaces. It is designed to be easy to integrate and use for creating debug tools and visualizations.

\subsubsection{Purpose}
Building the emulator's \textbf{graphical user interface}.

\subsubsection{Justification}
ImGui is \textbf{fast, portable and flexible}. It's ideal for building debugging interfaces or minimalistic GUIs for tools.

\subsubsection{Integration}
Directly integrates with \textbf{SDL2} for rendering and complements the emulator's debugging tools by providing real time visual feedback.

\section{Development Tools}

\subsection{Visual Studio Code}
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports a wide range of programming languages and extensions.
